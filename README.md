## What's Google Foobar

[Google Foo Bar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com) called foo.bar, is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine. There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges that follow a story.

The system has been used by Google for at least a year and is triggered when a user enters certain search terms relating to coding languages like Python and Java. The search results page breaks open to reveal the message "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?" to which the user can decline once, request the message isn't shown again, or click "I want to play".

You get given a time limit for each challenge, ranging from a day to
a few weeks, and your code is run against hidden test cases (including
how fast and memory) efficient it is!

I completed some level of this challenge, and have no work left to do on it unless
Google sends me more.

## My challenge questions

The challenge consists of 5 levels consisting of algorithm problems.
It was really a great experience so far.
The first few levels were relatively easy, but as the levels peaked up, the difficulty gained heights.

Currently I am on level 5 and just have one more label to go.

Upon completing level 3, I had to submit my personal details with a potential recruiter for a future interview.
The Google Foobar is presumably still hiring and its needed to submit solution either in **Python** or **Java**.
I don’t know about the future upcomings for this, but to be honest I really enjoyed the challenges.
Looking forward to solve more.

Inside each level is a challenge folder with a problem file describing the challenge and constraints, and my solution to the challenge.
